# Features
* Users can register themselves on the website and organize cleanliness drives in their areas, providing service to the community. They can provide information about the date, time, location.
* Other users can view the ongoing cleanliness drives, and if interested, they can volunteer and participate in the drives.
* The platform also allows users to track their personal statistics, such as the number of drives they have organized, or number of drives participated in. This feature helps users track their progress, set personal goals, and motivate them to contribute to the community.
